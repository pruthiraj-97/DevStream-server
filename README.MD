# Real-Time Code Collaboration Backend

This project is the backend for a real-time code collaboration platform where users can collaboratively write, compile, and execute code. The platform provides real-time code synchronization, integrates code execution services like JDoodle, and uses MongoDB and Redis for session management.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: Database to store user data, session history, and code files.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store used for caching sessions and handling real-time updates.
- **Socket.io**: WebSocket library for real-time communication between the server and clients.
- **JDoodle API**: Integrated AI for code execution and compilation.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pruthiraj-97/DevStream-server
   cd DevStream-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create an `.env` file with the following configuration:

   ```bash
   PORT=4005
   MONGO_URI=your-mongo-uri
   JDOODLE_CLIENT_ID=your-jdoodle-client-id
   JDOODLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-jdoodle-client-secret
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
